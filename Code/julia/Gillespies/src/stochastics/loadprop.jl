Includes the file relative to the const `PROPDIR`

I originally tried to make this load a module in the function,
similar to how python can do an `import_module` â†’ `getattribute`.
However, Julia does not support modules at anything less that the
top level, so I had to simplify it to just include the file.

I take it back, Julia does support something similar, it was just that
I kept using a number for the start of the module name, which
is unsupported.

But it still doesn't seem to be the best strategy?

Oh wait, I need to ensure that the full field path is output
I'm just gonna load all the modules and see what happens
