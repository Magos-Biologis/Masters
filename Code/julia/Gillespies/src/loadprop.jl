Includes the file relative to the const `PROPDIR`

I originally tried to make this load a module in the function,
similar to how python can do an `import_module` â†’ `getattribute`.
However, Julia does not support modules at anything less that the
top level, so I had to simplify it to just include the file.

I take it back, Julia does support something similar, it was just that
I kept using a number for the start of the module name, which
is unsupported.
